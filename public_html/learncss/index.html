        <h1>Caleb Forstrom: The Website</h1>
        <p id="story">Let me tell you the story of my life. I was born July 12, 2000 to my parents Sierra and Dave in the great state of Utah.
        A few years later, my father moved us over to Virginia for a new job. Six years after that we moved again to Redmond, Washington.
        I lived there for many years until I went to Texas to preach the good word of God. Now I am married and go to school at BYU.</p>

        </div>
        <p id="nice">None of the above pictures are all that relevant to whatever is going on, I just had them handy to put into the 'learncss' folder. But how 'bout all the fancy font-styles and boxes and whatnot?</p>

            <p id="choose">The choice is yours. Choose the red pill to waste time filling your brain with usless, mind-numbing entertainment. Choose the blue pill to fill your soul with God's neverending love and begin
            to sing the song of redeeming love.</p>
